## Abstract
---
- Codes that **always returns a value** like `5+6` return s `11`. [[Function]] and [[Macro]] are also considered as expression
- Can be part of a [[Statement]] like `5+6` in `let a = 5+6`




## Rust Expression
---
- `if` in [[Rust]] is an [[Expression]], so we can do the following `let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };`
