## Abstract
---
- **A set** of [[Instruction]] that can be triggered to **accomplish a particular task**

### Function Signature 
- Refers to the declaration of a function
- Including its name, return [[Datatype]], and parameter datatype

## First-class Citizen Function
---
- [[Function]] that can be manipulated and used in flexible ways **like a variable**. This is what powers [[#Higher-order Function]]

>[!important] Behave and treated like a variable
> 1. Assigned to variables
> 2. Passed as arguments to other functions
> 3. A function can be the return value of another function
> 4. Can store functions in data structures like [[Array]], [[List]], or [[Hash Map]] etc
>    
> This enables powerful programming techniques like [[#Higher-order Function]] and [[Closure]] etc.

>[!important]
> There isnâ€™t first class citizen function in [[Java]], Java creates an **illusion** of it using [[Java Lambda]] & [[OOP#Functional Interface]].

## Higher-order Function
---
- A [[Function]] that takes in **another one or more functions** as **inputs** or **return a function** as its **output**

>[!important]
> Higher-order function builds on top of [[#First-class Citizen Function]], we need it, so we can **pass function into another function** or **return function from another function** as if function is like a **variable**.

## Rust Function
---
- For [[#Function Signature]], you **must** declare the [[Datatype]] of each parameter
- So [[Language Processors#Compiler]] almost never needs you to use the function elsewhere in the code to figure out what type you mean. The compiler is also able to give more helpful error messages if it knows what types the function expects.

- Return the last [[Expression]] implicitly
