## Abstract
---
- Allows a machine to access another machine that is within a private network via a [[Network Port]]

## Port Forwarding into Fly.io App
---
```bash
flyctl proxy <local:remote> -a <APP_NAME>
```
## Port Forwarding into EC2 Bastion
---
>[!caution] EC2 Configuration
>Make sure you are using an **Amazon Linux Image**, or you have [setup system manager on EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-setting-up.html)


- The EC2 Bastion is inside an AWS private subset, blocking all incoming traffic from the internet
- With the help of [[AWS SSM]], we are able to port forwarding a port of the bastion host to a localhost port
- So we are able to access the service running on a particular bastion host port by accessing a localhost port
```bash
aws ssm start-session --target <bastion instance id> --region ap-southeast-1 --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSession --parameters portNumber="5432",localPortNumber="5432"
```
