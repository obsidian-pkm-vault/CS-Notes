## Abstract
---
- An entity used to track *time spent* by an app processing a request & the *status* of the request
- Made up one or more [[Span]]
- Identify the [[Span]] for [[Latency Number |Latency]], then we can carry on with optimisation


## Terminologies
---
### Metrics
- Captures request counts, error counts, and latency measures of requests
### Runtime Metrics
- Allow to view [[Address Space#Heap Segment]], non-heap memory usage and [[Garbage Collector]] activity of the app
- [[Datadog]] can have this enabled with `export DD_RUNTIME_METRICS_ENABLED=true` 
### Instrumented
- Code or tools have been added to the application to monitor, measure, or analyze its behavior during execution
- Provide insights into the application's performance, functionality, and other operational characteristics
- This is particularly useful for debugging, performance tuning, and monitoring purposes
### Pipeline
- [[Datadog]] example

#### Host-side
- We can tune the [[Sampling]]
	- *Library Sampling* overrides *Agent Sampling*
- *Trace Metrics* are the [[#Metrics]], directly connected [[#Instrumented]] application, calculated based on 100% of the app's traffic
#### Datadog backend side
- *Live Search* allows us to search [[Span]] using any tag or [[Span]]
- *Generate Custom [[Monitoring#Metric]]* from [[Span]]
- *Retention Filters* - how long we want to retain the trace
- *Dashboard* used to give a visual representation of the app for optimisation and debugging
