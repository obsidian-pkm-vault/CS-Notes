## Abstract
---
- **Discrete objects**, for example there is a clear separation between $1$ and $2$, unlike there can be $1.25$ between $1.2$ and $1.3$
- Used a lot in [[Discrete Math]]
- The mathematical symbol is $\mathbb{Z}$


## Theorems
---
### Theorem 4.4.1
- *The Quotient-Remainder Theorem*
- Given any [[Integer (整数)]] `n` and positive integer `d`, there exist unique integers `q` and `r` such that
$$
(n = dq + r) \land (0 \le r < d )
$$

### Theorem 4.6.1
- *There is no greatest integer*
- Proved by [[Mathematical Proof#Proof by Contradiction (反证法)]]
