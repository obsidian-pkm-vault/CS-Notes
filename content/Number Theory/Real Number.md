## Abstract
---
![[real_number_line.png|500]]
- Contains both [[#Rational Numbers (有理数)]] and not rational numbers
- Represented with the symbol $\mathbb{R}$ (-1, pi, 4.5)

## Rational Numbers (有理数)
---
- `r` is rational $\leftrightarrow$ there are integers `a` and `b` such that `r=a/b` and `b!=0`
- Represented with the symbol $\mathbb{Q}$ (0.5, -23, 8.5)

### Theorem 4.2.1
- Every integer is a rational number
### Theorem 4.3.2
- The sum of any two rational numbers is rational
### Corollary 4.2.3
- The double of a rational number is rational 
- Derived from [[#Theorem 4.3.2]]

## Complex Number
---
- Extended form [[Real Number]]
- Represented with the symbol $\mathbb{C}$ (9.1i)
