## Abstract
---
- Basically a brute-force method that explores all possible paths
- Backtracking is an **Algorithm Strategy,** while [[Recursion]] is more like a **Algorithm Tool.** Recursion powers searching problems
- 回溯算法通常并不显式地对问题进行拆解，而是将问题看作一系列决策步骤，通过试探和[[#Pruning (剪枝)]]，搜索所有可能的[[#Solution (解)]]
- We can perform [[#Pruning]] to improve the performance, but this will not change the overall worst case
- [[Iterative Recursion]] doesn't work well to implement this algorithm, stick to [[Recursion]] - backtracking allows us to implicitly create multiple nested for-loops until we find the desired answer

## Tips in solving Leetcode
---
### [[#Pruning (剪枝)]]
- When in finding sum questions, *sort* the given [[Array]] before backtracking, then we can skip the rest of the loops if +the next element is bigger

### Remove Duplicates in [[#Combination]]
- Sort the given set
- At each level, we skip the elements that have the same value as the previous element
```java
// In the primary function
Arrays.sort(nums);

// In Backtracking function
for (start = start; start<nums.length; start++) {
	// ...
	while(start < nums.length-1 && nums[start]==nums[start+1]) start++;
}
```
### 2 Ways to Remove Duplicates in [[#Permutation (排列)]]
1. Use a [[Hash Set]]/[[Array]] to remove duplicates at each level, *given the element value is small*
```java
// Without the need to sort the given array in the primary function

// In Backtracking function
boolean[] duplicates = new boolean[21];
for (int i=0; i<nums.length; i++) { 
	if (duplicates[nums[i]+10]) continue;
	duplicates[nums[i]+10] = true;
	// ...
}
```
2. Sort the given [[Array]], then remove duplicates by checking if the previous element is same as current element && isn't used which means the previous element with the same value can be used, resulting in a duplicated [[#Permutation (排列)]]
```java
// In the primary function
Arrays.sort(nums);

// In Backtracking function
if (i>0 && nums[i-1]==nums[i] && visited[i-1]==false) continue;
```

## Terminologies
---
### Solution (解)
- The answer that fulfil all [[#Constraint (约束条件)]]
- Can be one or many
- Path(s) that fulfil all the [[#Constraint (约束条件)]]
### Constraint (约束条件)
- Conditions that limit the [[#Solution (解)]], usually used in [[#Pruning (剪枝)]]
- For example, the [[#Solution (解)]] must contain certain number of nodes or sum up to a particular value
### State (状态)
- Represents the problem at any point of the time, including the choices made
### Attempt (尝试)
- The process of finding potential [[#Solution (解)]] with the provided choices
- Including making the choice, updating the [[#State (状态)]] and check if it is the [[#Solution (解)]]
### Backtracking (回退)
- Removing the previous choice made & return to the previous [[#State (状态)]]
### Pruning (剪枝)
- Based on [[#Constraint (约束条件)]], Avoid exploring some paths fully when we know there isn't a point to explore nodes on the rest of the path or other paths, to save on the computation 
- For example, when the question says the [[#Solution (解)]] must contains a certain number of nodes, we can terminate [[#Attempt (尝试)]] if we see there is no way to get to that number of nodes
