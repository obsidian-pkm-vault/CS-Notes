## Abstract
---
- An **optimisation technique** by storing the results of **expensive** function calls and return the **cached result** when the same inputs occur again

>[!bigbrain] Improves computation efficiency
> With the cost of space, we **avoid redundant computations** and improve the overall performance of the program.
