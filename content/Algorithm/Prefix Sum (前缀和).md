## Abstract
---
- Basically an [[Array]] same length of the given array
- The value at each index is the sum of values from index 0
- Efficiently calculates sums of **ranges within an array** by leveraging on [[Memoization]]

## Property
---
### O(1) Range Sum Query
- With one time computation of the [[Prefix Sum (前缀和)]] in `O(n)`, we can retrieve the sum of elements in a [[Array#Contiguous Segment]] in `O(1)`
- Let $P$ be a prefix sum of a given array, $Range(i, j)$ sums up the element in between the $i$ and $j$ (inclusive) of the given array
$$
P[j]  = P[i-1] + Range[i, j]
$$
- Thus, we can obtain the sum of any sub-sequence of the given array in `O(1)` with the following formula
$$
Range[i, j] = P[j]- P[i-1]
$$

>[!tip]
>$Range[0, j]$ is **same** as $P[j]$
## Complexity
