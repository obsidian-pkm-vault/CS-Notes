## Abstract
---
- 3 components
	1. **Starting point**: break down the big problem, and sum up the answers of sub-problems, and return it as final answer
	2. **Progression**: obtaining the answers of sub-problems
	3. **Base case**: the terminating point of recursion
- 递归解题思路主要还是聚焦在一个节点，想想在这一个节点上要做点啥，递归就像‘水波纹’把这‘做点啥’传递到其它节点上

### Recursion Function
- A function that calls itself during its execution
- Instead of using iteration (loops), a recursive function breaks down a problem into smaller subproblems and solves each subproblem by calling itself
