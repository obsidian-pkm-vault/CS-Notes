## Abstract
---
- Instead of manually assign a specific value to [[#Predicate Variable]] to obtain a [[Mathematical Statement]]
- **Quantifiers** is another way to specify **how many** of a particular type of values that can make the [[Predicate]] a **closed predicate**
- There are 2 types, represented with either  $\forall$ or $\exists$

>[!caution] Order of Quantifiers
>Unless the **Quantifiers** are of the **same type**. Otherwise, the meaning is different
>
> Given $P(x,y)$ is **x loves y**
> 1. $\forall x \exists y, P(x,y)$  in english: For all people x, there is a person y such that x loves y.
> 2. $\exists y \forall x, P(x,y)$ in english: There is a person y such that all people x, x loves y. 
>    
> - The first one means for everyone (you, me, he), there is someone we love
> - The second one means there is someone who is loved by everyone (you, me, he)

>[!info] Multiply-Quantified
> Predicate with more than one Quantifiers

>[!info] Implicit quantification
> The Quantifiers are assumed without specified explicitly
