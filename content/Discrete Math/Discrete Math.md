## Abstract
---
- [[Mathematical Proof]] in [[Mathematical Argument]]
- Loosely a collection of interesting applied math topics outside of *Calculus*



## Terminologies 
---
### Sets
- N - All Natural number (0,1,2,3,4...)
- Z - All integers (315, -9045)
- Q - All rational numbers (0.5, -23, 8.5)
- R - All real number (-1, pi, 4.5)
- C - All complex number (9.1i)
>[!sidenote]
>- Z is Q, and Q is R

### Axioms (公理)
- Universally recognized truth or principle
- [[Mathematical Statement]] assumed to be true without [[Mathematical Proof]]
### Theorem (定理)
- [[Mathematical Statement]] that is proved using *Mathematical Reasoning*
- Usually a major or important result 
### Lemma (引理)
- A small [[#Theorem (定理)]] used to help in proving a [[#Theorem (定理)]]
### Corollary (推论)
- A result that is a *simple deduction* from a [[#Theorem (定理)]]
- For example, we proof that `the product of any two odd numbers is always odd`. The corollary is `the product of two sonsecutive odd numbers is always odd`
### Conjecture (猜测)
- [[Mathematical Statement]] *believed to be true*, but there isn't a [[Mathematical Proof]] yet
