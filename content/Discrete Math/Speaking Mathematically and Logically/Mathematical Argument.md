## Abstract
---
- A sequence of [[Mathematical Statement]] ending in a [[#Conclusion]]
- Every step should *follow logically* from all previous steps
- `IF (p AND ... p) THEN Conclusion` is a [[Mathematical Statement#Tautology `t`]]
- A *argument* can be [[#Valid]], but if the [[#Premise]] is not true, the [[#Conclusion]] is going to be false

## Testing An Argument Form for [[#Valid]]
---
- There is [[#Critical Row]] in which [[#Conclusion]] is false: [[#Form]] is *invalid*
- The [[#Conclusion]] in every [[#Critical Row]] is true: [[#Form]] is [[#Valid]]

## Terminologies
---
### Form
- The [[Mathematical Statement]] in *Mathematical Argument* is expressed in variables
### Premise
- Also known as *Assumption* or *Hypothesis*
- A [[Mathematical Statement]]
### Conclusion
- A [[Mathematical Statement]] that must be true when all [[#Premise]] are true, in order for the *Mathematical Argument* to be [[#Valid]]
### Valid
- [[#Form|Argument Form]] is said to be *Valid* if and only if whenever [[Mathematical Statement]] substituted that make all [[#Premise]] true, and the [[#Conclusion]] is also true 
### Critical Row
- A row of *Truth Table* in which all the [[#Premise]] are true

### Sound
- A *argument* is called *sound* if & only if it is [[#Valid]] & all the [[#Premise]] is true
