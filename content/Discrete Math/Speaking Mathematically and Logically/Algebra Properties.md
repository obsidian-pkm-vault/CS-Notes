## Abstract
---
### Closure (闭包)
- An property of a *set* whereby an operation on members of the set always produces a member of the same set
- For example, Integers are *closed* under addition and multiplication like *1+1=2*, where 2 is an integer (*By  closure of integers under multiplication and addition*)
### Commutativity (交换律)
- The *order in which the operands* are taken does not affect the result of the operation
- Addition & multiplication are *commutative*
- x+y = y+x
### Associativity (结合律)
- Do not need to worry about the *placement of parentheses* in expressions with more than two operands
- Addition & multiplication are *associative*
### Distributivity (分配律)
- Multiplication distributes over addition
- ```x * (y + z) = (x * y) + (x * z)```
### Trichotomy (三分法)
- For any *two given inputs*, there are exactly *three possible outcomes*. One of the outcomes *must be true*
- `x=y`, `x<y`, `x>y`
