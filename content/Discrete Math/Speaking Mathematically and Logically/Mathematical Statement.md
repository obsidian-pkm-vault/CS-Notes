## Abstract
---
- Also known as **Proposition** 
- **Can be presented with variables** like `p`, `q`, `r` & `s` which return either `True` or `False` etc
- 3 important types are [[Universal Statement]], [[Conditional Statement]] & [[Existential Statement]]. We can form **complex statements** that are made of more than one type

>[!tip] Keep It Atomic
>This makes the cognitive load low, easier to build on top of the statement, especially for [[Mathematical Proof]] that is complicated

>[!caution] Attention
>1. [[Predicate]] without value substituted to its [[Predicate#Predicate Variable]] isn't mathematical statement, unless it is [[Propositional Logic#Logical Equivalence]] equation that involves predicate. For example $\neg(\forall x, P(x)) \equiv \exists x, \neg P(x)$
>2. Not in a question form
>3. Either `True` or `False`, but not both at the same time


### Logical Connectives 
- Negation: `NOT` performed first
- Disjunction: `OR` ,Conjunction: `AND` coequal, make sure proper parentheses is used to avoid [[Propositional Logic#Ambiguous]]
- If-then/implies: performed last, coequal with `iff`

### Compound Statement
- Make up with [[#Statement]] variables & [[#Logical Connectives]]

>[!tip] Simplification
>When the statement has [[Conditional Statement]], convert it using [[Conditional Statement#Implication Law]] to make it much less confusing



## Terminologies
---
### Statement/Propositional Form
- Make up with [[#Statement]] variables & [[#Logical Connectives]]

### Tautology `t`
- [[Mathematical Statement]] that is **always true** 
### Contradiction `c`
- [[Mathematical Statement]] that is **always false**
