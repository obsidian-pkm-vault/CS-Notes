## Abstract
---
- Basically a [[Common Sets#Subset]] of [[Set#Cartesian Product]] filtered by some conditions which define the relation among the elements from the given [[Set]]

>[!example] Real-world Implication 
> Commonly used in [[Database]], the columns are the different sets, the Cartesian Product of the columns are all the potential relation aka all the rows that can be stored inside the database. Each row is a actual [[Set#Order n-tuples]] inside the relation


### Binary Relation
- Let $x \in A, y \in B$, we say $x~R~y \leftrightarrow (x,y) \in R$

### Inversion of Relation
- Basically reverse the order of elements of the [[Set#Order n-tuples]]
$$
R^{-1} = \{(y,x) \in B \times A : (x,y) \in R\}
$$

## Composition of Relation
---
- The composite of 2 [[Relation]] - `R` and `S`
- Given [[Set]] `A`, `B`, `C`, $R \subseteq A \times B$ and $S \subseteq B \times C$
$$
\forall x \in A, \forall z \in C (x S \circ R z \leftrightarrow (\exists y \in B (xRy \cap ySz)))
$$
- For all $a$ in $A$ and all $z$ in $C$,  the below 2 conditions must be fulfilled in order to have composition of relation $S\circ R$
	1. If there is a 'path' from $x$ to $z$, there must have a path from $x$ to $y$ AND $y$ to $z$ , the $S\circ R \rightarrow (\exists y \in B (xRy \cap ySz))$ part
	2. If there is a 'path' from $x$ to $y$  and $y$ to $z$, there must has a path from $x$ to $z$, the $S\circ R \leftarrow (\exists y \in B (xRy \cap ySz))$ part

### Composition is Associative
- Let $A, B, C, D$ be [[Set]]
- The we have 3 [[Relation]]: 
	- $R \subseteq A \times B$
	- $S \subseteq B \times C$
	- $T\subseteq C \times D$

$$
T \circ (S\circ R) = (T\circ S) \circ R = T \circ S \circ R
$$
### Inverse of Composition
- Let $A, B, C$ be [[Set]]
- The we have 3 [[Relation]]: 
	- $R \subseteq A \times B$
	- $S \subseteq B \times C$

$$
(S \circ R)^{-1} = R^{-1} \circ S^{-1}
$$

## Relation Properties 
---
- Not properties of the elements of the [[Set]]!
### Reflexive 
- Every element in the given [[Set]] must be related to itself

$$
\forall x \in A (xRx)
$$

### Symmetric
- If an element is related to another element, the another element must be related to this element too

$$
\forall x,y \in A (xRy \rightarrow yRx)
$$

### Transitive
- If an element is related to another element, and that element is related to a third element. Then this must be related to the third element

$$
\forall x,y,z \in A (xRy \cap yRz \rightarrow xRz)
$$

### Equivalence Relation
- Let $A$ be a [[Set]] and $R$ be a [[Relation]] on $A$
- $R$ is equivalence relation iff $R$ is [[#Reflexive]], [[#Symmetric]] and [[#Transitive]]

### Equivalence Class
- Basically same as the **component** of a [[Common Sets#Partition]] or elements of [[#Equivalence Relation]]
- Can be represented with $[a]_{relation}$, it means the Equivalence Class contains element $a$
- $[a]_{relation}$ and $[b]_{relation}$ are the same iff $b$ is in the same equivalence class as $a$

## Theorem
---
### Lemma Rel.1
- [[#Equivalence Relation]]
- Let `~` be an *[[#Equivalence Class]]* on [[Set]] $A$ and $x, y \in A$
	1. $x$ is equivalent related to $y$
	2. The equivalent class $x$ is in is same as the equivalent class $y$ is in
	3. $[x] \cap [y] \ne \emptyset$

### Theorem 8.3.4
- The [[Common Sets#Partition]] induced by [[#Equivalence Relation]]
- If $R$ is equivalence relation on [[Set]] $A$, then the distinct [[#Equivalence Class]] form a partition of $A$
## Terminologies
---
### Arrow Diagram 
- Visualize  [[Relation]]
- Usually used when there is more than one [[Set]] involve in the relation


### Relation Domain
- Basically the [[Set]] of elements of the left hand Set that is involved in the [[Relation]]
$$
\{a \in A : aRb \space for \space some \space b \in B\}
$$

### Relation Co-domain
- The whole [[Set]] at the right hand side

### Range
- Basically the [[Set]] of elements of the right hand set that is involved in the [[Relation]]
$$
\{b \in B : aRb \space for \space some \space a\in A\}
$$

### N-ary Relation 
- A [[Relation]] involving 2 [[Set]] is called **binary relation**, also known as 2-ary
- Ternary is 3-ary
- Quaternary is 4-ary

### Congruence Modulo 3
- [[Modulo#Congruence Modulo]] 3 means the [[Integer (整数)]] is divisible by 3
$$
\forall x,y \in \mathbb{Z} (xRy \leftrightarrow 3 |(x-y))
$$
- A [[Relation]] that is [[#Reflexive]] [[#Symmetric]] & [[#Transitive]]

### Transitive Closure of Relation
- The [[Relation]] obtained by adding the least number of [[Set#Ordered Pair]] to ensure [[#Transitive]]
- Represented with $R^{t}$
- Following 3 properties:
	1. $R^{t}$ is transitive
	2. $R \subseteq R^{t}$
	3. $R^{t} \subseteq S$, where $S$ is any other transitive relation that contains $R$
