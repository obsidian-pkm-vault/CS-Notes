## Abstract
---
- Also known as **Geometric Progression**, **Geometric Sequence**
- A sequence is **a list of numbers**, each of which is called a term. **Each term** after the first is found by **multiplying** the **previous term** by a **fixed, non-zero number** called the **common ratio**
- The `nth` term of a sequence is given by $a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{(n-1)}$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, $n$ is the term number, $r$ is the common ratio

>[!example]
> - $1, -2, 4, -8, 16 \ldots$ (common ratio: $-2$)
> - $-5, 15, -45, 135 \ldots$ (common ratio: $-3$)



## Arithmetic Sequence
---
- An arithmetic sequence is **a list of numbers** where the **difference** between any **two consecutive terms** is **constant**. This constant difference is called the **common difference**
- The `nth` term of an arithmetic sequence is given by $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, $n$ is the term number, $d$ is the common difference

>[!example]
>- $3, 7, 11, 15 \ldots$ (common difference of $4$)
>- $10, 5, 0, -5 \ldots$ (common difference of $-5$)
