[Original Problem](https://codeforces.com/contest/1918/problem/B)
## Approach
---
### Consensus
- Given 2 [[Permutation]], we can swap any 2 elements at a time, the catch is that, when we swap the 2 elements of the first permutation, we need to do the element swapping at the exact position for the second permutation
- The goal is to have the **minimal** [[Permutation#Permutation Inversion]] **sum** of the two permutations

### Idea
- Lets abstract the problem, let the 2 elements we want to swap in the first permutation be $a_i,a_j$, where $i,j$ are the position index, and $i<j$. Let the 2 elements we want to swap in the second permutation be $b_i,b_j$
</br>

- Lets think about when it makes sense to swap. It makes sense to
