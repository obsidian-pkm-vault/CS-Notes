## Abstract
- [[Datatype#Custom Datatype]] that is [[Immutable]] (a new object is created when a new value is assigned)
- Make [[Datatype#Primitive Datatype]] to fit into the [[OOP]] concept
- Has built-in method to convert current value to other Primitive Datatype or custom datatypes

> Comes with cost of allocating [[Address Space#Heap Segment]] for OOP Object & [[Garbage Collector | collecting garbage]] afterward. Thus, less efficient than Primitive Datatype
