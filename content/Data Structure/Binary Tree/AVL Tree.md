## Abstract
---
![[avl_tree.pngg|500]]
- Also known as **Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree (平衡二叉搜索树)**
- A [[Binary Tree (二叉树)]] that is empty OR with nodes that are all [[Binary Tree (二叉树)#Height-Balanced]]
- An optimised [[Binary Search Tree (二叉搜索树)]] 

>[!success] Efficient Operations
> The self-balancing property guarantees that the[[Binary Tree (二叉树)#Height]] of an AVL tree with $n$ nodes is always around $O(log n)$. This means operations like searching, insertion, and deletion take a maximum of $O(log n)$ time, making them very efficient.
