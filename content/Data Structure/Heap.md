## Abstract
---
- A [[Tree]] based structure that satisfies the [[#Heap Invariant]]

>[!important]
> Heap forms the classical underlying [[Data Structure]] for [[Priority Queue]].

### Heap Invariant
- Also known as **Heap Property**
- If node $A$ is a parent of node $B$, then $A$ is ordered with respect to $B$. This ordering applies to all nodes $A$ and $B$ within the [[Heap|heap]]
- In a max heap, the value of a **parent node** is **always greater than or equal** to the values of its **child nodes**. Conversely, in a min heap, the value of a parent node is **always less than or equal** to the values of its child nodes
