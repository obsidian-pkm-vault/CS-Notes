## Abstract
---
- An [[Abstract Data Type (ADT)]] that operates similarly to a standard [[Queue]], except each **element** inside the queue **has a certain priority**. This priority **determines** the **order** in which **elements are removed** from the priority queue.

>[!important]
> A priority queue **only supports comparable data**, meaning that data inserted **must** be able to **be ordered**, either from least to greatest or greatest to least. This allows us to **assign relative priorities** to each element.
