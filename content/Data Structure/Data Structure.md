## Abstract
---
- The way [[Data]] is organised and structured
- We want it to save as much space as possible and be accessed as efficient as possible 



## Physical
---
### Continuous Memory
- Elements are stored one next to another in the[[Virtual Memory]]

### Discrete Memory Location
- Elements are scattered around the [[Virtual Memory]]
- The exact location depends on [[OS]]'s **Memory Management**


## Logical
---
### Linear
- Each element has a predecessor and a successor, except for the first & last element
- Elements stored in a straight line
>[!example]
>- [[Array]]
>- [[Linked List]]
>- [[Stack]]
>- [[Queue]]
>- [[Hash Map]]
### Non-linear
- 2 types - **Hierarchical Relationship**([[Tree]]) and **Interconnected Relationship** ([[Graph]])
>[!example]
>- [[Tree]]
>- [[Heap]]
>- [[Graph]]
>- [[Hash Map]]
