## Basics
---
>[!abstract] [[Stack]] & [[Queue (FIFO)]] combined
>![[deque.png]]
>- [[Linear Data Structure]]
>- Aka [[Array]]/[[Linked List]] with limitations





%%>[!example] Use as
>1. Online ordering system%%

%%>[!example] [Use Cases](https://github.com/youngyangyang04/leetcode-master#栈与队列)%%


## Implementation
---

%%>[!note] Implementation wit[](Array.md#Circular%20Array)]]
>
>- [Visual](https://www.hello-algo.com/chapter_stack_and_queue/queue/#2)
>- push() at the rear index
>- pop() & peek() at the head index%%

>[!note] Implementation with [[Double Linked List]]
>- [Visual](https://www.hello-algo.com/chapter_stack_and_queue/deque/#1)
>- We need [[Double Linked List]] in order to have the ability to pollLast() - delete from the rear. With [[Single Linked List]], we are unable to get the previous node, which means we cant update rear when we delete from the backl
