## Abstract
---
- Resizable [[Array]], achieved by building an [[Abstraction (抽象)]] above the Array

>[!tip] Convenient
> Developers don't need to re-write battle-tested logic of re-sizeing Array etc, battery-packed with best practices.

>[!attention] More Resource Intense
> We can't fine tune every Array operations because the implementation details are abstracted away. We only have interfaces to interact with it.
