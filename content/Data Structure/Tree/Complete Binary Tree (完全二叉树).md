- [[Perfect Binary Tree (完美二叉树)]] except the last [[Tree#Level|level]] may not completely filled
- The nodes on the last level are **strictly arranged from left to right**
- Perfect binary trees are often used to implement [[Heap#Binary Heap|binary heaps]]
- We can use [[Binary Tree#Binary Tree Array Representation]] to implement the complete binary tree
