description: Getting alerted when something bad is about to happen
---
## Abstract
---
- This system tracks overall health by **observing predefined [[Observability#Metric|metrics]]** and **alerts** you when something goes wrong **based on established thresholds**, preventing issues before they escalate


## 4 Golden Monitoring Signals
---
- **Latency:** The time it takes for a request to travel from the client to the server and back
- **Traffic:** The number of requests a system receives over a specific period
- **Error rate:** The percentage of requests resulting in errors, such as 404 Page Not Found or 500 Internal Server Error
- **Saturation:** A measure of resource utilisation, including CPU, memory, and disk space


>[!success] Data points for optimisation
> These data points allow us to easily **evaluate overall performance** and **application health**, enabling informed decisions about **optimisation** and **scaling**.
