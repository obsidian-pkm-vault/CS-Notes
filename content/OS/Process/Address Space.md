## Abstract

![[address_space.png|300]]

- A list of memory locations from **0** to **some maximum**, which [[Process (进程)]] can access
- Address space is powered by [[Virtual Memory]], so everything in address space is dedicated to that particular process
- 4 main components
	- Data in [[#Text Segment]] (the **orange** block shown above) and [[#Data Segment]] (the **red** block shown above) are shipped with the program
	- Data in [[#Heap Segment]] (the **blue** block shown above) and [[#Stack Segment]] (the **green** block shown above) are allocated dynamically when the program is running

### Heap Segment
- **Dynamically allocated region** where the [[Process (进程)]] can create new data structures as needed
- **Grows** and **shrinks** as the **process** allocates and deallocates memory

- Grow upwards
- Region of [[Virtual Memory]] where data can live indefinitely even when function returns
- Expansion is done explicitly during **program runtime** using [[System Call (系统调用)]] like `brk()` in [[Kernel]] that follow [[POSIX]] or higher level [[Library Call]] 
</br>

- Require manual memory management from the process - process of allocating memory and deallocating memory. See language examples below
- When assigning one variable to another variable, data is **not duplicated**, instead the [[Pointer]] to the data is duplicated and assigned
- A nice visualisation on memory allocation can be found [here](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#boxes-live-in-the-heap)

**Java**
- Memory allocation with `new` keyword, and memory deallocation is done by [[Garbage Collector]] automatically

**Rust**
- Memory allocation with `Box::new()` function, and memory deallocation is done automatically using [[Rust Ownership#Box Deallocation Principle]]

**C**
- Memory allocation with `malloc()` function, and manual memory deallocation is done with `free()` function

>[!caution] Manual Memory Deallocation is Dangerous!
>After we manually deallocated the heap memory associated with a [[Pointer]], then try to read data from the same pointer, it will lead to undefined behaviours. Thus, resulting in [[Memory Safety#Poor memory safety]]
>
>Refer to this [section of article](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#rust-does-not-permit-manual-memory-management) for more details

>[!caution] Memory leak
>Happens when we **forget to release** data in heap memory using `free()` in the example of C
>
>This can eventually lead to the exhaustion of available [[Main Memory]], resulting in **degraded performance** or even **program crashes**
### Stack Segment
- **Dynamically allocated region** used to store **function calls**, local variables, and temporary data etc
- Made up of [[#Stack Frame]], follow a [[Stack]] structure
- **Grows** as functions are called and **shrinks** as they return

>[!question]- Grows Downwards
>Stack Segment starts at a higher [[Memory Address]], then memory address decreases as we add in **Stack Frame**, thus **growing downwards** in terms of Memory Address, so to remove stack frame, we need to increment the [[Register#Stack Pointer]]

>[!info]- Fun Fact Regarding Grow Downwards
> Growing downwards is a convention from when computers had small memories and the stack was placed at the end of the [[#Data Segment]]. Nowadays the stack can be anywhere, but the convention stuck on, at the end of the day it makes no difference


- When assigning one variable to another variable, data is **duplicated**
- For example, `a=1` `b=a`, the value `1` is duplicated and assigned to `b`
- A nice visualisation can be found [here](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#variables-live-in-the-stack) 

>[!success] Data management in Stack Segment is more efficient than Heap Segment
>1. Stack memory is allocated and deallocated in a **Last In, First Out (LIFO) manner**, making it faster than heap memory. This is because all it needs to do is move the [[Register#Stack Pointer]] up or down, while heap memory requires more complex memory management
>2. No overhead of complex [[Synchronization (同步)]], unlike data inside heap segment, data inside the stack segment is usually dedicated to that particular [[Process (进程)]] or [[Thread]]. Thus, manipulation of data inside the stack segment doesn't require the complex synchronisation 

>[!caution] Stack Overflow
>Happens when the **size of all the stack frame** is **over** the **default fixed size** of the stack segment

>[!caution] Variable Size Defined before Compilation

>[!example]- XV6-RISCV Kernel Stack
>```c {13}
>// xv6-riscv kernel codes, start.c
>
>#include "types.h"
>#include "param.h"
>#include "memlayout.h"
>#include "riscv.h"
>#include "defs.h"
>
>void main();
>void timerinit();
>
>// entry.S needs one stack per CPU.
>__attribute__ ((aligned (16))) char stack0[4096 * NCPU];
>
>// a scratch area per CPU for machine-mode timer interrupts.
>uint64 timer_scratch[NCPU][5];
>
>// assembly code in kernelvec.S for machine-mode timer interrupt.
>extern void timervec();
>
>// ...
>```
>- A **stack segment** is created, and it is shared by all the [[CPU]], each takes **4096 bytes**
>- **NCPU** is hard-coded to `8`, so the stack has a length of **32768 bytes**
>```asm {14-19}
># xv6-riscv kernel codes, entry.S
>
># qemu -kernel loads the kernel at 0x80000000
># and causes each hart (i.e. CPU) to jump there.
># kernel.ld causes the following code to
># be placed at 0x80000000.
>.section .text
>.global _entry
>_entry:
>	# set up a stack for C.
>	# stack0 is declared in start.c,
>	# with a 4096-byte stack per CPU.
>	# sp = stack0 + (hartid * 4096)
>	la sp, stack0
>	li a0, 1024*4
>	csrr a1, mhartid
>	addi a1, a1, 1
>	mul a0, a0, a1
>	add sp, sp, a0
>	# jump to start() in start.c
>    call start
>spin:
>	j spin
>```

>- We load the base address of the **stack segment**
>- Then based on the core id (0-7), we set the [[Register#Stack Pointer]] for each [[CPU]]. We can see the stack pointer starting point is obtained by adding `(hartid * 4096)` to the base address, this is because **stack segment grows downwards** when we are adding values to the stack

#### Stack Frame
- A section of the [[#Stack Segment]] dedicated to a **specific function call**

### Data Segment
- This region stores **global** and **static variables** and **constants** used by the program, pre-defined before the execution of the program
- Can be both read and write, allowing the [[Process (进程)]] to manipulate the data as needed

### Text Segment
- Stores program codes, **unchangeable**, **read-only**
