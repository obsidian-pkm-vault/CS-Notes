## Abstract
---

- Container that holds all the information needed to run a program, [[Abstraction (抽象)]] over running program
</br>

- 2 Components - [[Address Space]], [[Process Control Block (PCB)]]
</br>

- Process **usually** don't share [[Main Memory]] among themselves for isolation purposes. We need [[Inter-Process Communication (IPC)]] for **inter-process communication** 


## Terminologies
---

### Core Image

- A _suspended_ [[Process (进程)]] consists of its [[Address Space]]

### Child Process

- Has the same [[User#UID|UID]] as its parent
### Process State
1. Running
2. Ready to Run - Could be running but [[CPU]] gave processing power to some other [[Process (进程)]]
3. Block - Process is waiting for some other things like **I/O** to finish working (eg. waiting for file to be read)
### Process Resources
- The followings are examples of process resources
	- [[Address Space]]
	- [[Register]] (Include [[Control Unit#Program Counter]] and [[Register#Stack Pointer]])
	- A list of open [[File]]
	- Outstanding [[Interrupts (中断)#Software Interrupt]]
	- List of related processes
	- [[Process Management]] information etc
