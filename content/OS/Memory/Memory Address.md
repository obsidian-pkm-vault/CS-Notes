## Abstract
---
- Can be either [[Virtual Memory#Virtual Address]] or [[Main Memory#Physical Address]]
- For a k-bit address, the addressable space is 2^k
- Largest address possible is 2^k-1, because we count from 0

## 2 Ways to Address
---
### Byte Addressing
- 1 [[Computer Data Representation#Byte]] for every [[Memory Address]]

### Word Addressing
- 1 [[Computer Data Representation#Word]] for every [[Memory Address]]
