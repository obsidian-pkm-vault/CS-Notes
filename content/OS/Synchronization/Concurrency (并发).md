## Concurrency (并发)
---
- A way to run multiple [[Thread]] at the same time, instead of running one thread after another thread is done . Thus, improving the overall performance
- Can be achieved with multiple [[CPU#Core]] or [[Context Switch]] when there is only one [[CPU#Core]]
- Used to maximise the use of resources on hand and handle multiple requests or events

## Parallelism (并行性)
---
- A subset of [[Concurrency (并发)]], [[Thread]] run on its own [[CPU#Core]], so it is concurrency running on multiple resources
