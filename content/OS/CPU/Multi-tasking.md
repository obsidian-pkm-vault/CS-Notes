## Abstract
---

![[multi_tasking.gif|500]]

- An extension of [[Multi-programming]]. The ability for [[Kernel]] to execute multiple tasks **at the same time** by giving each [[Process (进程)]] a very small [[Timeslice]], achieving [[Concurrency (并发)]]. Focusing on improving user experience

>[!question] VS Time-sharing?
> In [[Concurrency (并发)#Time-Sharing]], we have multi-users instead of multi-tasks. Multi-tasking focuses on the tasks, and the tasks can be from different users. So in that sense, multi-tasking is a superset of time-sharing
