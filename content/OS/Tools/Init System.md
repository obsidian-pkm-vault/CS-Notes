## Abstract
---
- A [[Process (进程)]] that runs in the background
- Most important [[Process (进程)]] with [[Process IDentifier (PID)]] **1**
- Manages the **lifecycle** of **all services** that run in the background
- Below shows a list of common init systems. Basically [[Systemd]] for [[Linux Kernel]], [[Launchd]] for [[MacOS]] and **busybox** for for [[OS#Embedded OS]] like [[OpenWRT]]

>[!tip] Something simpler
> If you just want to run a task in the background after the user logs out, you can just run `nohup <command> &`, the **standard output** and **standard error** streams are redirected to a file named `nohup.out` in the **current directory by default**. But this doesn't restart the service on failure or after a reboot etc.
