## Abstract
---
* Chip that control the flow of bits between [[Main Memory]] and some [[Device Controller]] without constant [[CPU]] intervention, solves [[#Busy Waiting]]

## Zero Copy
---
![[zero_copy.png|500]]

- Zero copy means [[CPU]]Â does not perform the task of copying data from one memory area to another or in which unnecessary data copies are avoided
- [[Kernel]] handles copy process via [[Direct Memory Access (DMA)]] avoids copying between [[Kernel Space]] and [[User Space]]

## Terminologies
---
### Busy Waiting
* Has a big disadvantage of involving [[CPU]] keep polling until [[Device Controller]] retrieves data from [[IO Device]]
