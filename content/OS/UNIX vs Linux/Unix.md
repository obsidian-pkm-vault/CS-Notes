- A **Unix-like** operating system is one that behaves in a manner similar to a [[Unix]] system, although **not necessarily conforming** to or being certified to any version of the [[#SUS]]
- A Unix-like application is one that behaves like the corresponding Unix command or shell. Although there are general philosophies for Unix design, there is no technical standard defining the term, and opinions can differ about the degree to which a particular operating system or application is Unix-like
