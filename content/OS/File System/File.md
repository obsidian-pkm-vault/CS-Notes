## Abstract

---

- Hide the nitty gritty of [[IO Device]], so users can focus on manipulating the content inside the IO Device
- Present programmer a clean [[Abstraction (抽象)]] of **device-independent** file
- Examples are Printers & Modems etc
</br>

- 2 parts - _Filename_ & [[Inode#Inode Number]], doesn't have any _metadata_ associated
### File Descriptor
- A small [[Integer (整数)]] associated with [[File]]
### File Permission
- In [[POSIX]], file permissions are handled by **rwx bits**


### File Compression
- Process of **reducing the size** of one or more files to save storage space

>[!code]- Compress files in different folders without  including the parent directories of the path
>```bash
>#!/bin/bash
>set -eu
>set -o pipefail
>
># Check if a filename argument is provided
>if [ "$#" -eq 0 ]; then
>  echo "Usage: xyz <filename> <path1> [<path2> ...]"
>  exit 1
>fi
>
>filename=$1
>
># Create a temporary directory
>mkdir myTempZip
>
># Copy required files to the temporary directory
>for arg in "${@:2}"; do
>  cp -R "$arg" ./myTempZip
>  echo "$arg"
>done
>
># Navigate to the temporary directory
>cd myTempZip
>
># Zip the contents of the directory
>zip -r "$filename" *
>
># Move the zip file to the parent directory
>mv "$filename" ../
>
># Navigate back to the original directory
>cd ..
>
># Remove the temporary directory
>rm -rf myTempZip
>```

### Useful File Commands
```bash title="Generate a hexdump from a binary file and display the output"
xxd <BINARY_NAME.bin>
```



### Line Break
- [[POSIX]] systems uses a single character called **Line Feed** `\n`
- While Windows uses **carriage return** and Line Feed, so 2 characters `\r\n`. This is because during typewriter times, you needed to mov the carriage to restart typing on the beginning of a line first, then turn the wheel to move the paper to change the line

>[!info] Hands-On!
>You can install `dos2unix` and `unix2dos` using [brew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) to play with line break
>
> You can view the hidden line break character by downloading and configuring `bat`, refer to [[MacOs Setup#Terminal Productivity Tools]] for more details

## Useful CLi Tools
### bat
- A cat(1) clone with wings.
```bash
brew install bat && echo "alias cat='bat'" >>~/.zshrc
```

## Terminologies

---
### Special File

- Make [[IO Device]] look like [[File]], so we can reuse the same set of file [[System Call (系统调用)]] on IO Devices
- By convention, kept in the `/dev` [[File System#Linux File System]]

**Block Special Files**
- Model [[IO Device]] that has a collection of *randomly addressable blocks* like like disk

**Character Special Files**
- Model [[IO Device]] that accept or output a *character stream* like keyboard
