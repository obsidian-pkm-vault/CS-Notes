## Abstract
---
- Used to handle [[CSMA#Collision]] by making the sender computers to wait for a random time interval before re-sending the [[Data]]
- If the [[Collision]] happens again which means there is [[Network Congestion]], the waiting time will grow exponentially to reduce the rate of [[Collision]]
- Used by [[Ethernet]], [[Wi-Fi]] and in the [[CSMA]] approach
