## Abstract

* Computers & other devices connected to [[Computer Network]], and comes with [[Socket#Network Domain Socket]], thus comes with [[IP Address]] and can be identified using [[Hostname]]
* Connected together by a network of [[Communication Links]] & [[Network Switch]]

>[!important]
> [[Network Switch]] isn't a host, since it doesn't have an IP address assigned to it. Unless it is a [layer 3 network switch](https://documentation.meraki.com/MS/Layer_3_Switching/Comparing_Layer_3_and_Layer_2_Switches).
