## Abstract
---
- **Increases** the **execution throughput of the machine** by processing multiple independent [[Instruction Stages]] simultaneously, supporting [[Instruction-Level Parallelism]].

>[!important]
> Pipelining **does not reduce the latency of a single instruction**, but it increases the throughput of the entire workload.

### Pipeline Width
- The [[Instruction-Level Parallelism]] capabilities - how many [[Instruction]] can be run in parallel in the same time
