## Abstract
---
- Represent different characters in terms of `0` and `1`
- There are many different character encoding standards like [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII), [GBK (character encoding)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GBK_(character_encoding)#:~:text=GBK%20is%20an%20extension%20of,%3A1993%2C%20or%20Unicode%201.1.) and [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) etc

>[!caution] Incompatible Encoding Standard
> Characters encoded in one standard may be displayed differently in another standard.
> 
> We should always use the same character encoding standard, UTF-8 is recommended. And if we see characters are not displayed correctly, we shouldn't save the file, because saving will overwrite the file with placeholders for those wrongly displayed characters.
