![[alu.svg|500]]

- A digital circuit inside [[CPU]] that is responsible to carry **arithmetic operation** like addition and multiplication etc
- ALU takes in **operand_1** and **operand_2** that are required to carry out the **arithmetic operation** and it also takes in [[Instruction#Opcode]] which tells the ALU **what arithmetic operation to carry out**
- Besides outputting the result of the arithmetic operation, the ALU also outputs a status bit, known as a **flag**, to **summarize the operation**, such as indicating overflow
