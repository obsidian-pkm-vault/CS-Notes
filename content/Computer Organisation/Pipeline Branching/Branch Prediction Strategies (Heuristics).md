## Abstract
---
- Basically saying we are guessing with some logic




## Strategies
---
### Static 
- [[Rule-based Approaches]] that may only consider one [[Instruction]] at a time
### Random
- Pick randomly between whether a [[Pipeline Branching]] is taken or not
- Aim for the perfect middle ground of 50%
### Dynamic 
- Typically has some learning or storage capability to detect patterns
- More complicated than [[#Static]] and [[#Random]]
  - using extra [[Main Memory]] like [[Heap]] to store the state
  - Load up multiple [[Computer Organisation/Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)/Instruction]] to analysis them
### Neural
