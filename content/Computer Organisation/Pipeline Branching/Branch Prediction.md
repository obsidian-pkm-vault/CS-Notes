## Abstract
---
- Perform [[Instruction-Level Parallelism]] based on the prediction of if [[Pipeline Branching]] is going out of the loop or going back to the start of the loop
- There are many different [[Branch Prediction Strategies (Heuristics)]]
- [[CPU]] use multiple of the [[Branch Prediction Strategies (Heuristics)]]


## Example
---
### Predict the branch is going back to the start of the loop
- Because we can only be wrong one time when the loop is going out of the loop
- If we predict the loop is going out of the loop, then we will be wrong as many time as the number of loop iterations
