## Abstract
---
- Instead executing [[Instruction]] one by one in sequence. With loops like **for-loop & while-loop**. We will jump from one [[Instruction]] back to previous [[Instruction]] that is many [[Instruction]] away
- Example
 ![[step_in.png]]


## Cons
---
### Potential hit on performance
- When we need to branch back to the destination, this will lead to [[Pipeline Flush]]
