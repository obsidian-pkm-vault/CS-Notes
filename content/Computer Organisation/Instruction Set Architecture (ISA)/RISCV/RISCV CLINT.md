## Abstract
---
-  At [[Memory Address]] `0x02000000`
- **CLINT** stands for **Core-Local Interrupt Controller**,  a hardware component in the RISC-V architecture that provides a simple and efficient mechanism for **generating interrupts within a core**
- Mainly 2 features:
	1) **Machine-mode** [[Interrupts (中断)#Software Interrupt]]
		- Generated by writing to the CLINT's `msip` [[Register]]
	2) **Machine-mode** timer interrupts
		- CLINT's [[Timer Chip]], which is a 32-bit countdown timer that can be programmed to generate interrupts at a specified frequency, useful for [[Concurrency (并发)#Preemptive Scheduling]]

## Components
---
### MTIMECMP
- Start at [[Memory Address]] `0x02004000`
- Stands for **Machine Time Compare**
- [[Register|Register]] used to generate **machine-level** timer interrupts
- Each [[CPU#CPU Core]] has one
- Implement both periodic timers and **one-shot** timers
### MTIME
- At [[Memory Address]] `0x02000000 + 0xBFF8 = 0x0200BFF8`
- A 64-bit [[Register]] that stores the current value of the [[Timer Chip]]
