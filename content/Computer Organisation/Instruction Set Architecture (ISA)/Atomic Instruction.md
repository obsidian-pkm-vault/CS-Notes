## Abstract
---
- A **read-modify-write (RMW)** [[Instruction]] on a piece of data, that appears to complete **instantaneously** and **without interruption**, even when multiple [[Thread]] or processors attempt to access the same piece of data simultaneously
- This ensures that a set of read-modify-write (RMW) operation's outcome on a piece of data is always **consistent** and **predictable**
- Commonly used in [[Semaphore (信号量)]] & [[Mutex (互斥体)]] etc which have state that need to be accessed and modified safely by multiple [[Process (进程)]]


## Benefits
---
### Prevent Race Condition
- With **read-modify-write (RMW)** united in one pieces, there is no way for one [[Thread]] to read, another Thread to write, and first Thread from overwriting the changes made by the second Thread
- Thus, preventing [[Race Condition (竞态条件)]]

## Examples
---
### Acquiring and Releasing Spinlock
- Atomic instructions are also used to acquire and release [[Busy Waiting#Spinlock]], which are locks that prevent multiple threads from accessing a shared resource simultaneously.
```c
// XV6-RISCV Kernel Codes, spinlock.c

// Acquire the lock.
// Loops (spins) until the lock is acquired.
void
acquire(struct spinlock *lk)
{
  // ...

  // On RISC-V, sync_lock_test_and_set turns into an atomic swap:
  //   a5 = 1
  //   s1 = &lk->locked
  //   amoswap.w.aq a5, a5, (s1)
  while(__sync_lock_test_and_set(&lk->locked, 1) != 0);

  // ...
}
```
