## Abstract
---

- Certainty - always gives the same output given the same input
- Efficient - takes as little computation as possible
- [Hash Value of different data structures](https://www.hello-algo.com/chapter_hashing/hash_algorithm/#634)

> [!note] Uses modular arithmetic to calculate bucket index
>
> -   We can use either [[Prime Number (质数)]] or [[Composite number]] if we are sure the key is evenly distributed.
> -   Else if there is some kind of pattern like, the key is a multiple of 3, prime number can reduce [[Hash Collision]]
> -   Thus, we usually use [[Prime Number (质数)]] to take the modules, since we can't predict the distribute of the keys


>[!tip] Key is Immutable
> If the key changes, then its **hash value will change**, and we will lose the mapping between the key & the bucket index.
> 
> Objects created on [[Address Space#Heap Segment]] can be key, because we use its [[Memory Address]] to generate the hash, instead of its value which is mutable.
