## Abstract
---
- Analysis **space** & **time** used, related with the input size and observing the trend when input size gets bigger
- The analysis isn't limited to particular machine. It applies to all the machines

>[!caution] It is all about [[Infinity (∞)]]
> ![[time_analysis_worstIsBetter.png|500]]
>- We are only thinking what is the complexity when the input size is approaching Infinity (∞)
>- So when the actual input size in real world is small, the algorithms with worst time complexity may run fast! 




## Terminologies
---
### Worst Space Complexity
- The [[Main Memory]] used **relative to the input size**
### Worst Time Complexity
- The time it takes **relative to the input size**
- [[Algorithm Complexity Analysis]]
