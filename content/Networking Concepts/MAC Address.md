- To uniquely identify the device when we are using [[CSMA]] approach

>[!info] MAC Randomization
> MAC randomization feature allows devices to use a randomized MAC address when connecting to a Wi-Fi network, supported by [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/102509) and [Android](https://source.android.com/docs/core/connect/wifi-mac-randomization-behavior).
