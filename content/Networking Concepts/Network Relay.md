## Abstract
---
- A **third-party server (the relay)** acts as an **intermediary** between two devices that want to communicate but can't connect directly (often due to firewalls or NAT). One example is the [[Secure Tunneling#Secure Tunneling Server]] and [[Email Routing]]

**Mechanism** 
- Both devices establish a connection to the relay server
- The relay server coordinates the data flow between the devices, even if they can't "see" each other directly on the network

>[!tip] Bridge of Differences
> Can be used to connect networks that use different [[Network Protocol]], extending the range of a network
