description: Use SSH as a 'VPN'. SSH dynamic port forwarding allows you to bypass network restrictions by turning an SSH server into a SOCKS proxy. This lets your client machine access websites or services through an intermediate server, even if they are blocked by your local network firewall.

## Abstract
---
- Turn [[SSH]] into a [[SOCKS#SOCKS Proxy]] that allows us to **bypass network restrictions**


 
>[!important] Bypass network restrictions
> ![[ssh_dynamic_port_forwarding.png]]
> 
> **Client machine** can be devices like our laptops that are connected to the company network which has a strict firewall setting that doesn't allow us to access this [wonderful website](https://notes.yxy.ninja).
> 
> **Intermediate server** can be a [[Host]] that is outside the company network that has access to the [wonderful website](https://notes.yxy.ninja), and most importantly it isn't blacklisted by the company's strict firewall, that means the **client machine** is able to access it without any issues.
> 
> **Destination machine** is basically the [[Host#Server]] that serves this [wonderful website](https://notes.yxy.ninja)

>[!important] Dynamic
> Unlike [[Local Port Forwarding#SSH Local Port Forwarding]] and [[Remote Port Forwarding#SSH Remote Port Forwarding]] where we need to specify a [[Network Port]] on the **remote server**, dynamic port forwarding doesn't need us to do so, because it allows us to forward the traffic to an **arbitrary destination** like a **website** the local machine is unable to access with the help of the **remote server**.
