## Abstract
---
- A [[Network Protocol]] that allows a single source to send [[Data]] to multiple receivers simultaneously
- Similar to [[Broadcasting]], but more efficient because data is is only *sent once*, and then replicated by network to reach all receivers
- When a source sends a *multicast packet*, it uses a [[#Multicast IP address]] as the destination address. The network then replicates the packet and sends it to all of the receivers in the [[#Multicast Group]]


## Common Use Cases
---
### Software Update
- Used to distribute software updates to multiple devices simultaneously
### Video Conferencing
- Send audio and video streams to multiple participants in a video conference
### Online Gaming
- Send game state updates to multiple players simultaneously


## Terminologies
---
### Multicast IP address
- [[IP Address]] in the range `224.0.0.0` to `239.255.255.255`

### Multicast Group
- A logical group for receivers who are interested in receiving [[Data]] from sender
- Joining is done by sending an [[IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol)]] join message to the network
- Once a receiver has joined a multicast group, it will continue to receive all of the packets that are sent to that group, until it leaves the group
