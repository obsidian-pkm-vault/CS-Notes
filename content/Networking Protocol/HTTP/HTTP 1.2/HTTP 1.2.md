## Abstract
---
[[HTTP 1.1]] but with the following 4 improvements 
1. [[HTTP Multiplexing (多路复用)]]
2. [[HTTP 1.2 Server Push]]
3. Compressing the [[HTTP Headers]] with [[HPACK]]
4. HTTP messages are binary-encoded instead of ASCII-encoded, this is more efficient for parsing & less readable for hackers
