## Abstract
---
- We need to a TCP connection before 2 [[Host]] can communicate over the [[Computer Network]]
- Established after [[TCP Handshake]]


>[!caution] Resource intense
> More resource is required on both [[Host#Client]] and [[Host#Server]] because TCP is a [[Network Protocol#Stateful Network Protocol]]


>[!info] TCP connection in browser
> Browser usually keep multiple TCP Connection to the same [[Host#Server]]. [[Chrome]] & [[Firefox]] default have 6 to have a balance between performance & resource usage
