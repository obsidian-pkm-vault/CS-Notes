## Fly.io SSL
---

![[flyio_ssl.png|500]]

- I am using a custom [[Hostname#Domain Name]] with my fly.io app. For some reason, the [[X.509 Certificate]] didn't get auto-renew. This leads to the inaccessibility to the fly.io app. I suspect it is because by the [Cloudflare DNS Proxy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/) which causes the custom domain verification to fail. I had to stop the proxy, run `fly certs delete <custom_domain_name>` and `fly certs create <custom_domain_name>` to get a valid X.509 certificate again
