## Abstract
---
- The purpose is to prove that something from signer(usually [[X.509 Certificate#Certificate Authority (CA)]]) is really from that entity
- The signature is a piece of [[Ciphertext (密文)]] - generated by encrypting the [[Hash Digest]] of the [[X.509 Certificate]]  with the Signer's Private Key. The [[Asymmetric Cryptography#Public Key]] is distributed to [[Host#Client]] to decrypt the ciphertext to obtain the hash digest. Then the client can perform the signature verification process


>[!success] Prevent Man-in-the-middle Attack

>[!caution] Doesn't work well on document that is too short
> When it is too short, it is vulnerable to brute-force attack. We can first run [[Hash Function]] on the document, then add abit padding to the [[Hash Digest]] before signing
