## Abstract
---
![[oidc_basic_sign-in_flow.svg|500]]
- Stands for **Open ID Connect**
- Builds on top of [[OAuth 2.0]]
- Instead of just giving back [[OAuth 2.0#Access Token]], it also gives back a 'badge' - information who you are -> [[#ID Token]]

>[!note] The workflow is pretty similar to OAuth 2.0 except
>1. [[OAuth 2.0#Scope]] in [[OAuth 2.0#Consent]] has ``OPENID``
>2. [[OAuth 2.0#Client]] receives both [[OAuth 2.0#Access Token]] & [[#ID Token]]

### ID Token
- A [[JWT]]
- Used for [[Authentication]], NOT [[Authorisation]]
- Contains [[JWT#JWT Claims]] like ``aud`` (Audience Property) which defines which [[OAuth 2.0#Client]] is meant to be the final recipient of the ID Token
- Contain [[OAuth 2.0#Resource Owner (Identity)]] info like email and username which can be used by Client to populate the application UI

### Identity Provider
- [[OAuth 2.0#Authorization Server]] that supports [[OIDC Authentication]]
