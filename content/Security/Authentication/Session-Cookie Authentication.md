## Abstract
---
![[session-cookie_authentication.png|500]]

- Addresses [[HTTP Basic Authentication#Cons]]. A **session ID** is generated to track the user's status during their visit
- The session ID is recorded both [[Host#Server]] and in the [[Host#Client]]
- On Client side, it is stored inside [[Cookie]]. This is the name origin for **Session-Cookie**
- On Server side, it is stored in the server [[Main Memory]] or an independent session server
- Users must still provide their username and password initially, after which the server creates a session for the user's visit. Subsequent requests include the cookie, allowing the server to compare client-side and server-side session IDs
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com) uses Session-Cookie Authentication, the cookie name is `JSESSIONID`

>[!success] Improved Security
> Usually comes with [[TTL]], and the token value has no relationship with the user password. So when a session token is leaked, the risk of data loss is smaller


## Cons
---
### XSS Attack
- The session [[Cookie]] can be hijacked by XSS attack which injects malicious scripts to send the session cookie to the hacker

### CSRF Attack
- Hackers deceive users' browsers into unknowingly executing actions on websites. Hackers create malicious sites or emails with links to the targeted site. When users click the link, their browser sends a request with their session [[Cookie]], making the server believe it's a genuine user request
- Websites can use anti-CSRF tokens or demand re-authentication for sensitive tasks to counter CSRF Attack

### Hard to Scale
- Each [[Session-Cookie Authentication]] requires server-side storage of the session state. This can become a performance bottleneck as the number of users and sessions grows
### Non-mobile Friendly
- Mobile app developers must directly manage cookies using the available APIs
