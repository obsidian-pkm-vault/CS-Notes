## Abstract
---
- Electronic component that is solid-state
- Derived from *Mechanical Relay* which is [[#Electromechanical]], then followed by vacuum tube which is [[#Electronic]]

## 2 main functions
---
1. Switch circuit on & off automatically with a much smaller current 
2. Amplify Signals


## Terminologies
---
### Electromechanical
- A mechanical device which is electrically operated
- Move much slower compared to [[#Electronic]], because we are moving a physical piece that has billion times the mass compared to [[#Electronic]]
- Less durable than [[#Electronic]]
### Electronic
- A component which is controlled by electric current aka a stream of electrons 
- Move much faster compared to [[#Electromechanical]], because we are only moving a very small amount of electrons
- Much more durable than [[#Electromechanical]], because we are talking about atomic level, no moving parts on a physical level
