## Abstract
---
- Electronic component that is solid-state which is controlled by electric current aka a stream of electrons 
- Derived from [[#Electromechanical Relay]], then followed by [vacuum tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube)

>[!important] 2 main functions
> 1. **Switch circuit on** & **off** automatically with a much smaller current
> 2. Amplify Signals

>[!success] Great speed & durability 
> The **on & off state** change is **much faster** compared to **electromechanical relay**, because we are only moving a **very small amount of electrons**.
> 
> **Much more durable** too, because we are **moving the parts** at **atomic level**.

## Electromechanical Relay
---
- A mechanical device which is electrically operated
- Move much slower compared to [[Transistors (晶体管)]], because we are moving a physical piece that has billion times the mass compared to transistor 
- Less durable than transistors
