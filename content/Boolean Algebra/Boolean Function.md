## Abstract
---
![[boolean functions.png]]

- Use **Truth Table** to prove if 2 functions equal to each other
- The function above is `x` [[AND]] `y` and `c`

## Complement Function
---
- Given [[Boolean Function]] F, the complement is denoted as F', is obtained by interchanging `1` with `0` & `0` with `1` in the **function's output values**
- An [Example](https://chat.openai.com/share/f317b4c5-1b1c-4abf-b8e1-30c6ee185ba4)

## Boolean Duality
---
- When the [[AND]]/[[OR]] operators and `0`/`1` values of a [[Boolean Function|Boolean function]] are interchanged, it remains valid
