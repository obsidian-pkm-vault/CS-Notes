## Abstract
---
- **Group** related [[Abstraction#Data Abstraction|variables]] and [[Abstraction#Control Abstraction|functions]] together to create a [[OOP#OOP Class|OOP class]]
- This class manages **how data is hidden** and allow **access** through **class itself** or its **methods**, ensuring **data safety**


## Tell, Don't Ask
---
- A principle in [[OOP]] that **tells** objects **what to do** rather than **asking** them about their **internal state** and then **making decisions based on that state**. This promotes [[Encapsulation|encapsulation]], **reduces** dependencies, and **enhances** code maintainability and readability. As a result, code is less likely to break when the internal state of objects changes

>[!success] Encapsulation
> By instructing objects on **what to do**, you ensure they **encapsulate their data** and provide a **well-defined interface for interaction**.

>[!success] Reduce dependencies 
> Reducing the dependencies between objects leads to a more **modular** and **flexible design**, where changes in one part of the system have **minimal impact on other parts**.

>[!success] Improves readability
> It makes the code easier to understand as it **focuses on actions** and **responsibilities** rather than on the internal states of objects.
