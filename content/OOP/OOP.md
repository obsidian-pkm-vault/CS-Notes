## Abstract
---
- There are 4 core principles in OOP - [[Abstraction (抽象)]], [[Inheritance]], [[Polymorphism]] and [[Encapsulation]]



## OOP Class
---
- An [[Abstraction (抽象)]] over a group of similar items that share the same properties and actions

### Inner Class
- An [[#OOP Class]] inside an OOP Class

### Anonymous Inner Class
- A [[#OOP Class]] without a name


### OOP Object
- An actual instance of [[#OOP Class]] that occupies some space in the [[Address Space#Heap Segment]]
- The variable holds a **memory pointer** to the OOP Object, not the values inside the OOP Object




## OOP Interface
---
- Defines a **set of methods** that a [[#OOP Class]] must implement if it chooses to implement that interface. It doesn't provide any concrete implementations for these methods
- Focus on **what a class should do** rather than **how it should do it**


## OOP Method
---
- The functions we specify in the [[#OOP Class]]

### OOP Abstract Method
- Methods declared **without a body**
