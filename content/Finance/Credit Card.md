---

![[credit_card_income.png|500]]

- The above diagram shows the [[Credit Card]] income composition of USA banks in 2019, that is a total of **140 billion dollars**, and more than $50\%$ of it is coming from credit cards that give user rewards
- $63.66\%$ of the income is coming from the [[#Credit Card Interest]], the **poor** is **likely to pay much more interest** than the rich since they are **less financially informed** and **less liquidity to pay back** 
- $29.31\%$ of the income is coming from the [[#Credit Card Interchange Fee]], merchant usually pass this fee back to the consumers, so the poor who is less financially informed and **not owing a credit card** is going to **pay this extra fee without any form of benefits** 
- $7.03\%$ of the income is coming from the [[#Credit Card Fee]], the rich usually pays **annual card fee** to get more benefits & **foreign transaction fee** when they are travelling, the poor usually pays **late fee** & **over-the-limit fee**

>[!important]
> If **everyone** uses credit card **wisely**, **avoiding credit card interest** and **minimise credit card fee**. The credit card business model is **unlikely to be profitable for banks.**
> 
> However, the poor tends to use credit card unwisely due to the lack of financial knowledge and liquidity. So **the poor gets poorer & the rich get richer** in this credit card business. 

### Credit Card Interest
- The interest fee charged on credit card is usually above $20\%$. The **poor** is **more likely to pay the interest** since they are more likely to **lack the liquidity** to pay their credit card debt and their **lower credit score** results in a **higher interest rate**

>[!info]
> There is a total of [$1.25 trillion credit card debt](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/average-credit-card-debt-household)  in USA, as of March 2024.

### Credit Card Fee
- The fee includes **annual card fee**, **foreign transaction fee**, **late fee** & **over-the-limit fee**
- Rich tends to have a higher **annual card fee** & **foreign transaction fee**. While poor tends to have a higher **late fee** & **over-the-limit fee**

### Credit Card Interchange Fee
- The is fee **charged on the merchants** when consumers use credit cards to make the payments. Merchants will usually **include this fee in the price of the product**. So people who aren't using a credit card is paying an extra fee here.
